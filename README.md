lab №2 "Web_maps" - readme.txt"
 
 How to Run:
    Run module maps.py with python 3.6
Files included in Project "web_maps":
1) "README.md"
2) "requirements.txt"
3) "maps.py"
4) "Map_test.html"
5) "locations.csv"
6) "word.json"
7) "Map_test1905.html"
8) "Map_test1906.html"
9) "Map_test1907.html"
10) "Map_test1908.html"
11) "Map_test1909.html"

The aim of this project is to present statistical data from files "world.json" and "locations.csv". 

The Module determines the dynamics of filmed movies during 1905 - 1909 years, and outputs data about the countries with
maximum amount of movies filmed in "Top_5.txt". Also current Module creates a web map which consists of 4 layers:
1) "openstreetmap"- Politics world map;
2) "Amount of Movies by year" - the map that demonstrates the amount of movies filmed on each location during the exact 
year selected by user; this map demonstrates the correspondence of location to the amount of movies filmed in the area.
3) "Movies by year" -  the map that demonstrates movie titles filmed on each territory during the year selected by user.
4) "Population" - the map demonstrates the density of population on World map in 2015.

2) \<head> - tells tech information about document;
3) \<body> - separates the body part of a document;
4) \<meta> - it defines meta-tags for browsers and searching systems;  
5) \<script> - describes the script itself. May contain links to other apps; 
6) \<link> - establishes connection with external document or web-page;
7) \<style> - defines styles of different elements of the web-page;
8) \<div> - sets separate partition of a document.

ConclusionВисновок:

in module files "Map_test1905.html", "Map_test1906.html", "Map_test1907.html", "Map_test1908.html",
"Map_test1909.html" are saved, which demonstrate how the amount of movies during 1905-1909 years has changed.
the result of the research made is visible in "Top_5.txt". 
The file demonstrates the dynamics of the movies filmed during the chosen period.
We observe the growing popularity of cinematography and the movement of movies producing centres in early XX century.
